You have to set Seur carrier in the stock picking you want to ship:

 * In the stock picking form go to *Additional Info* tab and choose Seur as carrier and the service and product code. You only be able to choose this if the state of the picking is 'Ready to Transfer.

 * When the picking is 'Transferred', it appears a *Create Shipping Label* button. Just push it, and if all went well the label will be 'attached'
