Installation
============

WARNING: This module conflicts with the Intrastat modules from the official
enterprise addons. If you have already installed these modules, you should
uninstall them before installing this module.

You need to add HS product codes for your company through the installation
wizard. It's automatically launched if installing the module from the UI.

If any other installation method is used, you can go to
*Settings > Technical > Actions > Configuration Wizards* on developer mode,
and launch there the wizard called "Import Spanish Product HS Codes"

The included codes are for 2020. Please check possible updates for this codes in:

https://www.agenciatributaria.es/AEAT.internet/Inicio/La_Agencia_Tributaria/Memorias_y_estadisticas_tributarias/Estadisticas/_Comercio_exterior_/Documentacion/Tablas_de_codigos/Tablas_de_codigos.shtml

This wizard also sets a sane default Intrastat transaction type for each kind
of invoice at company level, but it can be changed later.

Configuration
=============

This module adds the following configuration parameters:

* Company

  - Arrivals : Exempt, Standard or Extended
  - Dispatches : Exempt, Standard or Extended
  - Default Intrastat Transaction
  - Default Intrastat Transport Mode (Extended Declaration)
  - Default Intrastat Incoterm (Extended Declaration)

* Warehouse

  - Intrastat State to cope with warehouses in different states

    The configuration of the Intrastat State on a Warehouse, requires a login
    belonging to the "Spanish Intrastat Product Declaration" security group.

* Intrastat Codes, Supplementary Units, Transaction Types, Transport Modes, States

  Cf. menu *Invoicing / Configuration / Miscellaneous / Intrastat Configuration*

* Product

  You can define a default Intrastat Code on the Product or the Product Category.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- The current version of the Intrastat reporting module is only based on invoices.
  Since associated stock moves are not taken into consideration, it is possible that manual
  corrections are required, e.g.

  - Product movements without invoices are not included in the current version
    of this module and must be added manually to the report lines
    before generating the declaration.

- The current version of the Intrastat reporting module does not perform a
  cross-check with the VAT declaration.
- Add tests.
