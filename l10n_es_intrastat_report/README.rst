===========================
Intrastat reports for Spain
===========================


This module implements the Spanish Intrastat reporting.

The report can be reviewed and corrected where needed before
the creation of the csv file for the declaration.

Installation
============

WARNING:

This module conflicts with the module *report_intrastat*
from the official addons.
If you have already installed these modules,
you should uninstall them before installing this module.


Configuration
=============

This module adds the following configuration parameters:

* Company

  - Arrivals : Exempt, Standard or Extended
  - Dispatches : Exempt, Standard or Extended
  - Default Intrastat State
  - Default Intrastat Transaction
  - Default Intrastat Transport Mode (Extended Declaration)
  - Default Intrastat Incoterm (Extended Declaration)

* Warehouse

  - Intrastat State to cope with warehouses in different states

    The configuration of the Intrastat State on a Warehouse, requires a login
    belonging to the "Spanish Intrastat Product Declaration" security group.

* Inrastat Codes, Supplementary Units, Transaction Tyoes, Transport Modes, States

  Cf. menu Accounting / Configuration / Miscellaneous / Intrastat Configuration

  The configuration data is loaded when installing the module.

  A configuration wizard also allows to update the Intrastat Codes so that you can easily
  synchronise your Odoo instance with the latest list of codes supplied with this module
  (an update is published on an annual basis by the Belgian National Bank).

  Some Intrastat Codes require an Intrastat Supplementary Unit.
  In this case, an extra configuration is needed to map the Intrastat Supplementary Unit
  to the corresponding Odoo Unit Of Measurement.

* Product

  You can define a default Intrastat Code on the Product or the Product Category.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- The current version of the Intrastat reporting module is only based on invoices.
  Since associated stock moves are not taken into consideration, it is possible that manual
  corrections are required, e.g.

  - Product movements without invoices are not included in the current version
    of this module and must be added manually to the report lines
    before generating the declaration.

- The current version of the Intrastat reporting module does not perform a
  cross-check with the VAT declaration.
