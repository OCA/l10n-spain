- The current version of the Intrastat reporting module is only based on invoices.
  Since associated stock moves are not taken into consideration, it is possible that manual
  corrections are required, e.g.

  - Product movements without invoices are not included in the current version
    of this module and must be added manually to the report lines
    before generating the declaration.

- The current version of the Intrastat reporting module does not perform a
  cross-check with the VAT declaration.
- Add tests.
