This module allows to import facturae invoices into odoo.

`Facturae
<http://www.facturae.gob.es/>`_ is the standard invoice syntaxis in Spain and
it is required to use this format for B2G invoices. Although the creation and
sending is managed in oca/l10n-spain, this module allows to import supplier
invoices into your system.

Accepts facturae invoices that include the following extensions:

* Extensión de FACeB2B

* CorreosExtension

* UtilitiesExtension

Known issues / Roadmap

with the following extensions:

* Extensión de FACeB2B

* CorreosExtension
